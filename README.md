# Molez

This is a game that we created in Swift. It is a whack-a-mole game where moles randomly on the screen, and the user's score increases if they hit a mole. The timer counts down from 30, and there are clocks that also randomly generate on the screen; if the user manages to tap on a clock, the timer added 2 seconds back to the clock.
